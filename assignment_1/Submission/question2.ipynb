    "After running the piece of code provided in the assignment interactively, we observe that initially when computing the dot product of two vectors a and b, the python-numpy returns the expected result for the inner product. However after transforming the vectors into column vectors, the dot product returns an error message. The error states that the dimensions of the operands are not valid, specifically \"size 4 is different from 1\". This implies that the dot product operator \"@\" does not inherantly know to use the transpose of one of the vectors to compute the outer product. This issue is resolved when using a.T as the operator. Furthermore, when attempting to print the float value of this computation, a deprication message is returned (as well as the correct answer), notifying the user that the functionality of converting all values in a matrix to a different data type using type-casting will be depricated in future versions of numpy"
